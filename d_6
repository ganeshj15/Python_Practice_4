#program to map two lists in to a dictionary

keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
values = [1, 2, 3]
d = {keys[i]: values[i] for i in range(len(keys))}
print("Dictionary after combining two lists:", d)

# Following is the alternate solution with the help of a builtin zip()
# keys = ['red','green','blue']
# values =[1,2,3]
# print("Dictionary after combining two lists:", dict(zip(keys,values)))
